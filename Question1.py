# Question 1Â¶
# Write a function called proportion_of_education which returns the proportion of children in the dataset who had a mother with the education levels equal to less than high school (<12), high school (12), more than high school but not a college graduate (>12) and college degree.

# This function should return a dictionary in the form of (use the correct numbers, do not round numbers):

#     {"less than high school":0.2,
#     "high school":0.4,
#     "more than high school but not college":0.2,
#     "college":0.2}
