# NIS-Child-2017-Project
This project is part of the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

## Project Overview

The project explores the NIS-Child 2017 dataset, which contains information on childhood vaccinations, socio-economic factors, and health indicators.
Throughout this project, I applied data analysis techniques using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to answer real-world healthcare questions, such as:
	•	Investigating the relationship between breastfeeding and flu vaccine doses.
	•	Exploring the correlation between having had chickenpox and the number of varicella (chickenpox) vaccine doses.
	•	Analyzing proportions of education levels among parents.
	•	Performing statistical correlation tests and interpreting the results.

### Skills Used
	•	Data Cleaning: Filtering and handling missing or invalid data.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Grouping, aggregating, and analyzing patterns in the dataset.
	•	Statistical Analysis: Using Pearson correlation to study relationships between variables.
	•	Python Libraries:
	•	pandas for data manipulation
	•	numpy for numerical operations
	•	scipy.stats for statistical testing

### Tools
	•	Python 3
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	SciPy
	•	Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
